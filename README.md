## ðŸŒ± [vinegarhill.garden](http://vinegarhill.garden) 
This project aims to serve the complex administrative needs of Vinegar Hill Community Garden in Brooklyn. We have designed a website with the following functionality:
-   Splashy landing page with general information and directions to facilitate wayfinding and bolster public engagement.
-  User registration with Google Groups integration for the garden mailing list
-   Members can:
	- Sign up for open hours
	-   Sign up for workdays
	-   Pay their dues
    -   Change login information
	-   Join the bed waitlist
-   Social integration with Gardenâ€™s Instagram account, @vinegarhillgarden  
-   Auto-populated donation link via PayPal API

The landing page and membership portal pages are designed with distinct interfaces and CSS stylings to highlight their functional differences.

#### Future goals:
 - [ ]  Add content management system (CMS) so tech Luddites can alter the content of the website
- [ ]  Increase security with password hashing or 3rd party authentication.
- [ ] Display signups in calendar format with one of many choices of React library
    

#### Software Stack:
- Frameworks and Libraries: SQLAlchemy, Skeleton.css, Bootstrap, others
- APIs: Google Maps API, Google Groups API, Paypal API, Social integrations
- Hosting and Deployment: Github, Vercel, ImprovMX (for email forwarding)
